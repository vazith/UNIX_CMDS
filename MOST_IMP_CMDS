---------> LINUX <-----------------

1. HOW CAN GIVE PERMISSION TO USER ..THAT USER NEEDS ALL
POWERS AND PERMISSION WHAT A USER DO'S ....?
EX :
----> in linux i created one user and im doing all the work by using 
that user now i using this cmd sudo reboot (it shows ERROR : WAS is not in the 
sudoers file. This incident will be reported.how can i resolve this issuse )

---( TO OVER THIS PROBLEM )---
          |
          V
     RUN THIS CMD 
       visudo
         |
         V
GO TO LAST LINES OF THAT FILE 
U SEE LIKE THIS
( ## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL

## Allows members of the 'sys' group to run networking, software,
## service management apps and more.
# %sys ALL = NETWORKING, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, STORAGE, DELEGATING, PROCESSES, LOCATE, DRIVERS

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
(EX:)%WAS ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL


## Same thing without a password
# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
(EX:)%WAS ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL < ----

## Allows members of the users group to mount and unmount the
## cdrom as root
# %users  ALL=/sbin/mount /mnt/cdrom, /sbin/umount /mnt/cdrom

## Allows members of the users group to shutdown this system
# %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d )


2. HOW CAN GIVE PERMISSION LIKE USER LIKE ROOT (FOLLOW BELOW METHOD) 

Here are the methods to grant root-like permissions to a user in Linux:

1. Adding the User to the root Group:

    Open a terminal window and use the usermod command:
     Bash
                  |
                  V
    sudo usermod -aG root <username>

    Use code with caution. Learn more

    Replace <username> with the actual username.

2. Granting Sudo Access:

    Use the visudo command to edit the /etc/sudoers file:
    Bash
                  |
                  V
              sudo visudo

    Use code with caution. Learn more

    Add the following line, replacing <username> with the actual username:

    <username> ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

3. Editing the /etc/passwd File (Not Recommended):

    Only use this method if the other methods don't work, as it involves directly editing a sensitive system file.

    Open the /etc/passwd file with a text editor:
    Bash   
               |
               v
    sudo nano /etc/passwd (OR) sudo vi /etc/passwd

    Use code with caution. Learn more

    Find the line for the user and change the UID and GID to 0:

    <username>:x:0:0:<user_name>:/home/<username>:/bin/bash

    Save the changes.
