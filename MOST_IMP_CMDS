         |
         V
GO TO LAST LINES OF THAT FILE 
U SEE LIKE THIS
( ## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL

## Allows members of the 'sys' group to run networking, software,
## service management apps and more.
# %sys ALL = NETWORKING, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, STORAGE, DELEGATING, PROCESSES, LOCATE, DRIVERS

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
(EX:)%WAS ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL


## Same thing without a password
# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
(EX:)%WAS ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL < ----

## Allows members of the users group to mount and unmount the
## cdrom as root
# %users  ALL=/sbin/mount /mnt/cdrom, /sbin/umount /mnt/cdrom

## Allows members of the users group to shutdown this system
# %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d )


2. HOW CAN GIVE PERMISSION LIKE USER LIKE ROOT (FOLLOW BELOW METHOD) 

Here are the methods to grant root-like permissions to a user in Linux:

1. Adding the User to the root Group:

    Open a terminal window and use the usermod command:
     Bash
                  |
                  V
    sudo usermod -aG root <username>

    Use code with caution. Learn more

    Replace <username> with the actual username.

2. Granting Sudo Access:

    Use the visudo command to edit the /etc/sudoers file:
    Bash
                  |
                  V
              sudo visudo

    Use code with caution. Learn more

    Add the following line, replacing <username> with the actual username:

    <username> ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

3. Editing the /etc/passwd File (Not Recommended):

    Only use this method if the other methods don't work, as it involves directly editing a sensitive system file.

    Open the /etc/passwd file with a text editor:
    Bash   
               |
               v
    sudo nano /etc/passwd (OR) sudo vi /etc/passwd

    Use code with caution. Learn more

    Find the line for the user and change the UID and GID to 0:

    <username>:x:0:0:<user_name>:/home/<username>:/bin/bash

    Save the changes.

4. how can  check current location 
>  pwd

5. HOW CAN CHECK SYSTEM DTE (or) TIME
> DATE (SHOWS LIKE HIS )
[ SUNDAY 06 AUGUST 2023 12:20:56PM EEST]
*IF WE WANT TO ONLY PARTICULAR DATE (OR) TIME (OR) MONTH
> DATE +D% [ 08/06/23 ] D =DATE 
> DATE +t [ 11:03] TIME
> DATE +%H:%M [ 12:34 ] H=HOURS M=MINTUES


5. HOW CAN DISPLAY FILES & DIRECTORY PRESENT IN CURRENT LOCATION 
> LS
> LS -LT [ SHOW MORE INFO ] L=LONG T= TIME
> LS -LTR [ SHOW LATEST CREADTED OR MODIFIED FLAST] R =REVERSE
> LS -LART [ SHOW ALL THE HIDDEN FILES ALSO ] A = ALL
> LS -LH [ SHOW FILE SIZE IN HUMAN READABLE ]

6. HOW CAN I KNOWS IT A FILE (OR) DIRECTORY 
> IS -LH
-RW-RW-RW-- 1 PAUL  PAUL 53 JUL 31 10:07 FILEA
DRW-RW-RW-- 1 PAUL PAUL  25 JUL 28 11:03 FILE.TXT
> - INDICATES IT A FILE
> D INDICATES IT A DIRECTORY 

7. HOW CAN CLEAN THE LINUX TERMINAL ?
