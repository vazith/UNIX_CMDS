---------> LINUX <-----------------

1. HOW CAN GIVE PERMISSION TO USER ..THAT USER NEEDS ALL
POWERS AND PERMISSION WHAT A USER DO'S ....?
EX :
----> in linux i created one user and im doing all the work by using 
that user now i using this cmd sudo reboot (it shows ERROR : WAS is not in the 
sudoers file. This incident will be reported.how can i resolve this issuse )

---( TO OVER THIS PROBLEM )---
          |
          V
     RUN THIS CMD 
       visudo
         |
         V
GO TO LAST LINES OF THAT FILE 
U SEE LIKE THIS
( ## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL

## Allows members of the 'sys' group to run networking, software,
## service management apps and more.
# %sys ALL = NETWORKING, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, STORAGE, DELEGATING, PROCESSES, LOCATE, DRIVERS

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
(EX:)%WAS ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL


## Same thing without a password
# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
(EX:)%WAS ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL < ----

## Allows members of the users group to mount and unmount the
## cdrom as root
# %users  ALL=/sbin/mount /mnt/cdrom, /sbin/umount /mnt/cdrom

## Allows members of the users group to shutdown this system
# %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d )
